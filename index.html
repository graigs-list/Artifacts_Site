      <h3>Sumerian Cuneiform Tablet</h3>

      <p>
        Between 3500 and 3000 BC, in Uruk, the cuneiform writing language was created. 
        This writing system spread across all Sumerian civilizations like wildfire due to its widespread, and necessary uses. 
        This cuneiform tablet was one of the earliest writing systems in the world. 
        This language enabled people in Mesopotamia to take records, write laws, and keep track of transactions. 
        They also used these to keep track of taxes, and items that were stored in the ziggurat, such as crops, money, other tablets, and weapons. 
        Cuneiform tablets were made of clay. They would be formed into a tablet, and then while wet, scribes would use reed styluses to inscribe messages into it. 
        The tablets would be sun-dried. Once dried, they would hold the message forever, or more often, until it cracked.  
        This invention helped organize the ancient river valley civilizations and helped modern-day scientists discover ancient laws, records, and the day-to-day life of Sumerians.

      <h3>Greek Wax Writing Tablet</h3>
      <img src="./images/tablet.png">
      <p>
        In around 1600 BC, the Greek language Linear B was created. 
        This language was an adaptation of Linear A to make writing on vases, murals, and clay tablets easier. 
        Eventually, the Greeks needed a more reusable portable writing system. 
        In this need, they created the wax tablet. 
        These tablets would be made of a wood tray, and filled with beeswax. 
        Once dried, the user would use a bone, metal, or wood stylus to inscribe letters on the tablet. 
        The resulting inscriptions would resemble letters in the Linear B language and would have many angles and straight lines, as the wax tablet made straight lines easier to draw. 
        In fact, modern-day “Greek Style” fonts look angular and with many straight lines due to the difficulty of writing curved lines on Greek wax tablets. 
        On these tablets, one could expect to write notes from public speaking, speeches, and just general day-to-day writings.
        Government officials would use these to organize tax collections and merchants could keep track of their orders, stock, and prices.
