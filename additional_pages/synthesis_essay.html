            <p>In early civilizations, there was always a way to communicate, whether it be through body language or spoken language. Yet as civilizations advanced, there was a need for a more concrete system, where the meaning could not be changed, and where ideas, rules, records, and religious texts could be stored for years to come. All civilizations came up with one resolution, a written language.  There were many different uses, yet while many civilizations developed a written language, most were created for two reasons, record keeping, and to inscribe legal and religious messages.
                As the city-state of Uruk was developing, many city-states now needed to communicate and trade. These city-states only had primitive interactions, where information could not be kept for long periods. The people and priests also found themselves losing hymns and prayers. The tax collectors realized that there had to be a way to create records, organize them, and make them concrete. All of Uruk found a necessity for a written language and around 3000 to 3500 BC, they developed cuneiform. Cuneiform was a primitive written language where scribes used styluses to carve inscriptions into wet clay, where the clay sun-dried, and left a permanent mark. Since the invention of Cuneiform, many records were created on it, such as taxes, cuts of farmers’ crops, trading and sale transactions, and religious texts, hymns, and songs. Eventually, a man named Hammurabi created a set of laws using this language, which the records of such have survived until today, showing how long these records may last. The creation of Cuneiform greatly aided in Mesopotamian city-states’ development, helping them record tax collection, keep track of events, and save their religious texts and excerpts for years to come.
                The Greeks were thriving, yet a major form of entertainment was performed solely from memory, by bards. This form of entertainment was storytelling or a form of a play. Many stories were lost during periods of Greek history where a written language was forgotten. There was one period in their history, when the writing language, Linear A and Linear B were forgotten. Throughout this period, laws must be enforced, and stories told, all by word of mouth. While Linear B was still in use though, many people would use wax tablets to write. To write on these tablets, the user would take a stylus and scrape letters into the wax. These letters were represented with very sharp angles and very straight lines, to make writing on wax easier. Another reason these tablets were used was because they were reusable. To resue the tablets they would rub the surface flat to fill in the depressions left by the old writing. To make the text more permanent, they would use a similar stylus in clay method like Cuneiform used. The Greeks would eventually use this language to write more important documents, until the Greek Dark Age. In all, the Linear B language preserved plays, religious texts, and laws, making it a vital step in the Greek’s development.
                The Egyptians were creating more and more complex structures, and they needed to make more complex, but more importantly, more precise math calculations. They needed some sort of written language to inscribe and keep track of their calculations. The Egyptians also lacked a way to write down prayers or warnings to not enter tombs. So around 3100 BC, the Egyptians conceived Heiroglyphics. Hieroglyphics were unique in the way that the “letters” were crude drawings of animals, body parts, and everyday items. To make these inscriptions, a scribe would chistle the message into the wall, or a stone tablet. If a person who died was royal, the Egyptians used this language to inscribe the names of the dead onto the walls of their tomb, and in the same room, they would write prayers for them. The Egyptians used their newfound language to write prayers and to inscribe messages for royalty.
                 In the Indus River Valley civilizations, at the start, there was no religion and no structure. So between 1700 to 1200 BC, a group wrote Rig Veda, with the new language Sanskrit. Before Sanksrit there was no social structure system in place, and Sanksrit filled that role when Rig Veda had the social structure embedded in it, the Varnas. Also known as the caste system, the structure was very controversial, yet it was intertwined with the religion of Hinduism itself. Sanskrit helped create the religion, and it created the social structure along with it. The caste system is the reason why the royals were royals, and why the untouchables were under the caste system, and untouchable. To write in Sanskrit, a writer would use paint and write messages onto a paper material, that could be made of reed. Not only did the Sanskrit language find the Hindu religion, and had the most important Hindu text written in it, but it also created a whole class system and effectively created a civilization on its beliefs.
                In Eastern Ancient China, the king needed advice from the gods, yet there was no communication system. So from 1368 to 1644 BC, the Old Chinese language was created. The priests used this language to communicate with dead spirits and the gods. To do so, the priest would paint characters onto a bone or tortoiseshell, and would then apply a hot poker to the bone, causing it to crack. These cracks in the message would be interpreted as the final say from the gods. This language and the interpretations of its messages directly influenced leaders, and subsequently, the kingdom itself. Eventually, many law codes were written in Old Chinese, and not only did this written language directly influence the kings, they also set rules for the people.
                In all, a written language was always a vital and necessary step for a civilization’s development. With these languages, some created a religion, some kept religions alive, and most had religious texts written in them. Most languages also had law codes written in them. These languages could influence kings, rule the people, and display the peoples’ beliefs. Most languages were created to start or inspire religions, and to impose laws on the masses.
